# LLM VRAM Calculator — Zero-Download GPU Memory Estimator

English documentation

> Parse any Hugging Face model topology without downloading weights, then estimate GPU VRAM from verified Architecture Profiles or an explicitly approximate generic KV Cache fallback. Initial profiles cover GLM 5.2, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Hunyuan 3, and Qwen 3.6 35B A3B.

## Contributing KV Cache Profiles with the skill

The repository ships [`add-kv-cache-profile`](skills/add-kv-cache-profile/SKILL.md), an agent skill that turns a model request into an auditable contribution. It pins upstream revisions, traces every persistent decode state, derives independent golden vectors, implements the Architecture Profile, and runs the required assurance and workload tests.

Fork and clone the repository, install its JavaScript dependencies, then make the skill discoverable to Codex by linking it into your personal skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/hf_model_viewer.git
cd hf_model_viewer
npm install

SKILLS_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
mkdir -p "$SKILLS_HOME"
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/add-kv-cache-profile" "$SKILLS_HOME/add-kv-cache-profile"
```

Start a Codex task from the repository root with a canonical Hugging Face repository and, when known, the revision to audit:

```text
Use $add-kv-cache-profile to add a dedicated Architecture Profile for
<organization>/<model> at revision <branch, tag, or commit>.
```

Agents that do not discover Codex skills can be given the file directly:

```text
Follow skills/add-kv-cache-profile/SKILL.md to investigate, implement, and
validate a KV Cache Profile for <organization>/<model>.
```

Before opening a pull request, review the generated evidence ledger and confirm that every persistent GPU-resident decode state is either represented by a buffer or explicitly excluded. The contribution must include immutable upstream evidence, independent golden vectors, config and commit drift coverage, model-specific workload boundaries, and successful `npm test` and `npm run build` results. If the available evidence cannot establish a complete KV Cache Layout, open an [issue](https://github.com/4mengy/hf_model_viewer/issues) with the research gaps instead of presenting the generic estimate as verified.

### Features

- **Zero-download parsing** — reads only the `safetensors` header JSON via HTTP Range requests, never downloading weight data; parses huge MoE repos in seconds.
- **Dynamic VRAM estimation** — computes per-tensor weight VRAM from on-disk shapes and dtypes, then adds the Effective KV Cache Payload from a dedicated Architecture Profile or the generic fallback.
- **Repository-routed Architecture Profiles** — a canonical Model Repository Identifier selects one dedicated Architecture Profile. The current commit and every algorithm-dependent config input are compared with the audited baseline; drift produces a warning while valid current inputs drive the calculation.
- **Generic KV Cache fallback** — repositories without a dedicated Profile use current config dimensions to approximate a uniform full-context MHA/GQA key-and-value cache. The result is always labeled `approximate` and exposes every assumption; it is never presented as a Verified Layout.
- **Initial dedicated layouts** — GLM 5.2 IndexShare, DeepSeek V4 Pro HCA/CSA (including indexer and compressor state), Hunyuan 3 full-context GQA, and Qwen 3.6 hybrid Gated DeltaNet/GQA. Each Profile owns one complete layout.
- **Auditable breakdown** — exposes repository provenance, Calculation Assurance, structured config differences, Architecture Profile/KV Cache Layout versions, and every buffer group's layers, element count, dtype, bytes, and formula.
- **Fine-grained composition** — overview chart breaks VRAM down by Tensor Name Pattern plus the Effective KV Cache Payload, with on-disk dtypes displayed alongside each entry.
- **Bilingual UI** — one-click Chinese / English switching, persisted locally.

### Design principle

The estimator counts the effective payload that model semantics require to remain GPU-resident. It excludes top-k workspaces, framework capacity padding, allocator fragmentation, offload, and optional speculative runtimes. If any required component is unknown, total VRAM remains unknown too.

### Math model

```
Vtotal   = Vweights + Vkv_cache
Vweights = Σ params × B_dtype / 1024³
Vkv      = Σ dedicated-profile or generic-fallback buffer bytes / 1024³
Vgeneric = 2 × tokens × layers × kv_heads × head_dim × dtype_bytes / 1024³
```

The verified semantic payload is `B × S × 95,232 bytes` for GLM 5.2 and `B × S × 327,680 bytes` for Hunyuan 3. DeepSeek V4 Pro separately accounts for HCA/CSA local and compressed KV, indexer KV, and F32 compressor live state. Qwen 3.6 35B A3B combines `20,480 bytes` per token for ten full-attention layers with `64,389,120 bytes` of BF16 convolution history and F32 recurrent state per active sequence across thirty linear-attention layers. The UI audit view exposes the complete per-buffer formulas.

The public `computeKV(...)` interface requires `source: { repoId, commitId }`, current config, and workload. The `estimateVRAM(...)` interface requires the same provenance plus tensor metadata. Both accept `sequenceLengths: number[]`; for ragged batches, GLM 5.2 and Hunyuan 3 use `Σ sequenceLengths`, DeepSeek V4 Pro evaluates window and compression transitions independently for every sequence, and Qwen 3.6 adds recurrent state only for active sequences.

Calculation Assurance is independent of estimate completeness. An audited commit with an exact algorithm-input baseline is `verified`. A valid newer config still produces a Complete VRAM Estimate from its current values, but the result is marked `warning` and reports the current commit, audited commit, and structured config differences. If no Profile exists, the generic calculation uses `num_hidden_layers`, attention/KV head counts, `head_dim` or `hidden_size / num_attention_heads`, and a configured cache/model dtype. Missing or unknown dtype defaults to BF16. Models with sliding windows, recurrent state, latent/compressed caches, or other custom semantics can differ materially, so this path always remains `approximate`.
